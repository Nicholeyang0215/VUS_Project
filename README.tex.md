# VUS_Project


This folder includes R code to conduct simulations for "A Likelihood-based Approach to Assessing Frequency of Pathogenicity among Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) in Susceptibility Genes".

Fampedigree.R: script to simulate family pedigrees.

Est_pi.R: script to estimate the proprotion of VUS that are likely pathogenic in simulated data. 

Est_pitheta.R: script to esitmate the proportion of VUS that are likely pathogenic in simulated data with the extension of `\theta`.

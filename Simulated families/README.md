## Description: This folder contains examples of simulated family dataset. 

### Dataset:
1. '1k_fam1.RData', '5k_fam1.RData', '1w_fam1.RData' are simulated family dataset of sample size = 1000, 5000, 10000 under script_num =1. 

2. 'fam1.RData' is the simulated family dataset of sample size 1 million. It is combined from  10 sub-family dataset of size 1e5. 


### Note: 
In the original paper, we simulate cohorts with 4 different sample sizes, N = 1000, 5000, 10000, 1 million. For N = 1000, 5000 and 10000, we have 2500 replicates. For N = 1 million, we have 50 replicates. 

For N = 1000, 5000 and 10000, the full set of simulated dataset can be obtained by using the following sbatch command line: 

sbatch --array=1-2500 sim_fam.sh
